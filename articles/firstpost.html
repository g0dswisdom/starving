    <h1>My first post</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm starved</p>
    <p>I decided to make this site because I was pretty bored with my life.. so yeah don't expect this site to be very good as I'm pretty new to this. It's fun though. And I'm learning new things.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working on Osiris, a selfbot for an app called Revolt that uses websockets to work. It currently has 42 commands and I think it's enough, but I'll keep on adding.</p>
    <p>A while ago I made Schizoid, a Roblox script that lets you control your alt accounts with commands. I'm thinking of releasing it to github, but the script is really simple to make so I don't think it's really worth releasing.</p>
    <p>I'll try adding articles and updates to this site as much as I can, even if no one reads them.. It's kinda fun.</p>
    <p>Well, thanks for reading my small post. Bye, internet person!</p>

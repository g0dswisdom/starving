    <h1>How the education system is completely ruined</h1>
    <h2 style="color: #95aac9">This is based on my actual life, routine for years. Based on real facts, Non-AI generated and trustworthy source.</h2>
    <h2 style="color: #d62323"> Morning routine, going through to and until the night</h2>
    <p>You wake up at 6-7 AM , rush to brush your teeth, make yourself a rich breakfast (if your parents do not accomplish this) and then get ready for school. Without in mind anything else as this is where you will be spending most of your time today. Prior to this, your day has 80% most likely spent on studying and doing exercises.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #d62323"> The Perpetual cycle</h2>
    <p>To go to school, you may have/need to take the bus or the publix transportation. The catch in this is that, its going to occur regardless of the weather forecast. Being late at school, will mostly conclude to you getting an absence and it being registered under your name with a reasoning "Not coming to school" and the chances itll get removed are signifcantly low. Its worth mentioning that certain schools dont really have school buses (private buses) so you are forced to take the public transportation. After arriving at school, you attend your first class which starts around 8:00 or 9:00 AM. You sit in a chair for 6-8 hours (we also do 8 hours but, everyday its 7 hours/7 days). You also probably sit with someone you dont like because that person was forced to sit there with you either because he was accused of speaking in class, disturbing the lesson or because they just want to bully you or make fun of you. You must be in character all the time, during the class which also means no smilling, no turning around otherwise you will be falsely accused by your teacher that youre communicating with another person in the class and not looking at the teacher or making eye contact with the teacher. So, youre just limited to mostly anything that you can do. Most that you can do is fucking breathe. You may either look at the clock, the hour hand and the minute hand when the time for your first **5** minute break and max, your 15 min break. You attend a class where- Oh wait. This school is Non-compulsory education but! its made to be compulsory education due to the nature of how everything works. If you dont have a degree, your chances of not finding a job skyrocket. Anyways, let me continue. You attend a class that highly wont be beneficial due to the old age of the books ~ The books are outdated and will probably never be renewed. There are mistakes, couple misinformation due to the new centuries that come. In the math subject, we all acknowledge that most of what it teaches us will not be used for our future unless we want to attend the positive direction cademic subjects. We mostly need +-/*, number powers and roots. Only these, most of the other stuff is just for high-level studies. Same goes for chemistry and physics. Too much information, yet only the 40% is required. From physics mostly what you would need to know is (Mechanics, Electricity and electronics, Materials and properties, Gravity and Safety).</p>
    <p>On each break, you get to see and talk with your friends which is probably only the positive feature about schools, communication. The break times are nerfed and very limited. Social development matters and is whwat makes us humans.This goes on until your desired time and school is over. You wait for the bus again (depends) and when you finally arrive at like 2-3, youre skipping the normal lunch time which is 1-2 while losing hours of your freetime/allocated freetime. You rush again to eat your lunch just so after that you either do chores, ready up your homework, take care of someone else or simply just play video games which is the rarest occasion. You spent more than 2 hours dedicated to studying as the homework assigned to you has a preresquisite to "broaden your horizons", time wasting. You have the need to enjoy your day, to feel happy to laugh but you are getting pressure from your side from your homework so youre forced to waste the time. Then at 6 you probably have some free time or you simply continue your studies/exercises. Reminding yourself you have to sleep at 10 just to be able to wake up tommorow and start over the cycle, you leave no time for video games or any other activity. You may also have extraccuricular activites which means you will also dedicate time on them. Usually, from 3 or 6 to 9.</p>

    <p><h2><em>EMPAHSIS ON STANDARDIZED TESTING IS NOT A WAY OF TESTING THE PERFORMANCE ACCURATELY AND HUMAN FRIENDLY. ITS A FUCKING WEIGHT ON THE STUDENTS.</em></h2></p>
    <p><h2><em>LACK OF TEACHER SUPPORT ALWAYS WILL EXIST. HEAVY WORKLOADS ARE APPLIED ON STUDENTS AND IF THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAV ENOUGH MONEY TO GIVE TO THE TEACHERS, THEY HAVE LOWERED SALARIES THEREFORE MORE NEGATIVE RESULTS.</em></h2></p>
    <p><h2><em>WE HAVE FUCKING OUTDATED TEACHING METHODS. PEOPLE ARE NOT ACQUSICENT OF CHANGING THIS EASILY. THE HUMAN MUST LEARN HOW TO BEHAVE AND HAVE MANNERS.</em></h2></p>

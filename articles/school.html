    <h1>Why our school system is absolutely fucked</h1>
    <h2 style="color: #95aac9">Before you read this, I want to say I realized I might've exaggerated about this after I wrote it. But I'll still post it because why not.</h2>
    <p>You wake up at 6-7 AM, brush your teeth and all that, and then you go to school. If you have an assigned seat, you need to sit next to a person you (probably) don't like, for 6+ hours. Every day you do the same useless shit, all over again.</p>
    <p>In our school it's also hot as fuck and the teachers have locked our windows. So just imagine sitting through that for more than 6 hours.</p>
    <p>When you arrive home, you have to waste a few hours doing your homework. Let's say you get out of school at 3 PM, you start doing your homework at 4 PM and it takes you 3 hours. It's already 7 PM, and most of the day is gone. (completely ruining your day).</p>
    <p>All of this bullshit for what, some "education"? Most of the things we learn in school are absolutely useless and do not help in life at all, such as:</p>
    <p> * In some cases, your native language (I already know how to speak and write in Polish, why bother making it a subject?)</p>
    <p> * Another language, which isn't English (The only language I need to learn is English, and that's because everybody uses it)</p>  
    <p> * PE (PE is fine, but why would the school feel the need to waste another 1 hour of our lives? We already go outside a lot.)</p>
    <h2 style="color: #95aac9"> Our grades, exams and grading system</h2>
    <p>I never understood the point of grades. When I was young, I thought school was supposed to be fun. You're supposed to study for a lot of hours, just to get a number on a paper because you memorized useless info. One of our teachers said grades define you, but I highly doubt that. Define what? My memorizing skills? Usually, if you have really bad grades, you're considered a lazy and awful person. But if you have good grades, you can be the most annoying and dumb person alive, and people will still consider you intelligent and nice because your grades are good. If school was actually supposed to be fun, instead of the boring old "stay quiet and write what I say without me explaining it" thing, how about we do something else?</p>
    <h2 style="color: #95aac9"> School uniforms</h2>
    <p>We have to wear uncomfortable clothing for hours, in a very warm and quiet room. Why can't we just wear our clothes, like normal people? We have to dress up and feel like shit for hours.</p>
    <h2 style="color: #95aac9"> Back to the main shit</h2>
    <p>While you're in school, you have to stay serious at all times. Can't even smile here. Teacher sees you smiling? You're going to get yelled at because they think you're laughing at them. Laugh in class? You're going to get yelled at again. It's not my fault some fucktard decides to be funny mid class.</p>
    <p>You're also supposed to waste a few hours of your day studying. Let's say after you finished your homework at 7 PM you realized there's an exam coming up tomorrow. Now what are you supposed to do? Honestly, you'd probably rather cheat in the exam but the chances of being caught are really high. So what do you need to do again? Waste 3-4 more hours of your day studying.</p>
    <p>And after studying, it's 10 PM. Now you're tired, and you're probably gonna go to sleep in around 2 hours.</p>
    <p>That is how school completely fucks up your life.</p>
    <h2>With that being said, I hope you enjoyed my rant on why our school system is fucking dumb. Thanks for reading & take care guys.</h2>
